# Secret-Key Capacity From MIMO Channel Probing

Run [illust.py](illust.py) to obtain illustration plots of the secrecy rate. For plots illustrating analytical secrecy rate and secrecy rate obtained from simulation, run [simu.py](simu.py). For detailed description, please refer to our [MILCOM23](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10356312) and [WCL24](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10460260) papers.
